# Gulp Front-End Boilerplate

A Yeoman generator that creates a minimal Gulp and Sass front-end workflow.

Based off of [Coder Coder's Gulp + Sass generator](https://github.com/thecodercoder/generator-gulp-sass-boilerplate)

## Instructions

Install Yeoman globally: `npm install -g yo`

Then install the Gulp Front-End boilerplate generator globally: `npm install -g generator-gulp-frontend`

Navigate to a directory you want to generate the files in, then run `yo gulp-frontend`

To run, you will need to have the Gulp CLI also installed globally:
`npm install -g gulp-cli`

Then in the project root, run the website by running `gulp`.
